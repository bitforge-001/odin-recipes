The patty is often seasoned with salt and pepper and can be grilled, fried, or broiled to the desired level of doneness. Burgers are commonly garnished with a variety of toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, cheese, bacon, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. They are often served with side dishes like French fries or coleslaw, making them a beloved choice for casual dining and fast food around the world.</p>
