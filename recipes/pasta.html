    <p>Pasta is a traditional Italian dish made from unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs. It is typically formed into various shapes and sizes, such as spaghetti, penne, fusilli, and lasagna. Pasta is cooked by boiling it in water until it reaches the desired texture, usually al dente, which means it is firm to the bite. It can be served with a variety of sauces, including tomato-based sauces, creamy Alfredo, pesto, or simply with olive oil and garlic. Pasta is often garnished with cheese, herbs, and vegetables, making it a versatile and beloved dish worldwide.</p>
