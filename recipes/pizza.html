    <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish made of a flat round bread base topped with flavorful ingredients and baked to perfection. The base, known as the crust, can be thin and crispy or thick and soft. A layer of rich tomato sauce is spread over it, followed by a generous amount of melted cheese—usually mozzarella.   
    Different toppings are added based on taste: vegetables like onions, capsicum, olives, tomatoes, and mushrooms; or meats like pepperoni, chicken, and sausage. When baked in a hot oven, the cheese melts beautifully, creating a golden, savory surface.</p>
